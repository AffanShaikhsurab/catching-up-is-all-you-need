## Papers in This Collection

### 1. LoRA Without Regret (Thinking Machines Lab)
**File:** `thinkingmachines-ai-blog-lora-.pdf`

A groundbreaking study demonstrating that **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** can achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning when configured correctly, using approximately **67% less computational resources**.

**Key Findings:**
- LoRA performs best when applied to **all weight matrices** (including MLP/MoE layers), not just attention layers
- The optimal learning rate for LoRA is consistently ~10x higher than for full fine-tuning
- LoRA is particularly effective for **reinforcement learning tasks**
- Establishes a "low-regret regime" where LoRA matches full fine-tuning performance

**Authors:** John Schulman et al. (Thinking Machines Lab)  
**Published:** September 2025
